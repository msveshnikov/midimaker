# `pipeline.py` Documentation

## Overview

The `pipeline.py` file contains the core functions that orchestrate the music generation process by interacting with the Language Model (LLM). It defines a sequence of steps, or a "pipeline," to transform a user's natural language description into a structured plan and then into symbolic music notation.

The main steps implemented in this file are:

1.  **Enriching the initial description:** Taking a brief user input and using the LLM to expand it with musical details like key, tempo, time signature, instrumentation, and structure.
2.  **Generating the section plan:** Based on the enriched description and suggested structure, creating a detailed breakdown of the musical piece into named sections with specified lengths and goals.
3.  **Generating symbolic music for individual sections:** Iterating through the section plan and generating the actual musical content for each section in a specific symbolic text format, using context from previous sections.

This file acts as the central coordinator, making calls to the LLM interface and performing validation and processing on the LLM's responses before proceeding to the next step or passing data to other modules like `symbolic_parser.py`.

## Role in the Project Structure

In the provided project structure, `pipeline.py` sits at the heart of the generation logic:
