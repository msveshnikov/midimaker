# Documentation for `midi_generator.py`

## File Overview

The `midi_generator.py` file is responsible for the final step in the music generation pipeline: taking the structured musical data (notes, instrument definitions, tempo, time signature, and key signature changes) and converting it into a standard MIDI file format using the `pretty_midi` library.

It handles the creation of the main `pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI` object, adding instruments, populating them with notes, and incorporating meta-messages like tempo, time signature, and key signature changes based on the provided data. Finally, it writes the complete MIDI object to a file on the disk.

## Role in the Project

As indicated by its likely use within a pipeline (suggested by the docstring "Step 5"), this file acts as the output module. It depends on data processed by earlier stages, such as symbolic parsing (`symbolic_parser.py`), potentially music structure generation (`music.py`), and configuration settings (`config.py`). It is typically called by a higher-level orchestration script (like `pipeline.py` or `main.py`) after all musical elements have been determined and structured.

## Dependencies

-   **External Libraries:**
    -   `os`: Used for path manipulation and ensuring the output directory exists.
    -   `math`: Used for calculating valid time signature denominators (powers of 2).
    -   `traceback`: Used for printing detailed error information in case of exceptions during file writing.
    -   `pretty_midi`: The core library used for creating and writing MIDI files.
-   **Internal Modules:**
    -   `config`: Imports the global configuration dictionary `config.CONFIG` to access settings like default tempo, time signature, key, and output directory.
