Unleash your inner composer with MidiMaker Generator!  Imagine turning your textual ideas into beautiful MIDI music.  This innovative app uses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform simple text descriptions into structured musical compositions, section by section, ensuring coherence and musicality even in longer pieces.

Are you a songwriter looking for a melody to match your lyrics? A game developer needing background music? Or simply curious about the intersection of AI and music? MidiMaker Generator is your perfect tool.

* **Compact Symbolic Format:**  Leverages a smart, text-based format that's both efficient for AI and easy to parse, ensuring accurate MIDI conversion.
* **Customizable Instruments and Styles:** Guide the AI with your descriptions – specify instruments (piano, guitar, etc.), tempo, key, and time signature to shape your musical creation.
* **Algorithmic Precision:**  Powered by a Python script (`music.py`) that meticulously converts the symbolic representation into a standard MIDI file, ready for use in your favorite music software.

**How it Works:**

1. **Describe your musical vision:** Start with a simple text prompt like "a happy upbeat pop song" or "a melancholic jazz piece in a minor key."
2. **AI Elaboration:** The app's LLM engine expands your idea into a detailed musical plan, considering structure, instrumentation, and mood.
3. **Section-by-Section Creation:** Music is generated section by section (e.g., Verse, Chorus, Bridge), ensuring a cohesive and structured composition.
4. **Symbolic Representation:** Each section is represented in a compact, text-based format that captures notes, chords, rhythm, and instrumentation.
5. **MIDI Conversion:** The `music.py` script transforms the symbolic text into a MIDI file (.mid) that you can use with any MIDI-compatible software.
