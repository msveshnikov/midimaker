# Prioritized Features

Here are the top 5 prioritized features or improvements for the Text-to-MIDI music generation project, based on the provided business insights, presented in a numbered and prioritized list:

**Top 5 Prioritized Features/Improvements:**

1.  **Focus on Musical Quality & Coherence Evaluation and Improvement:**
    * **Justification:** This directly addresses the biggest technical risk and the core differentiator (long-form, coherent music).  If the generated music isn't musically satisfying and coherent, the project will struggle regardless of other features.
    * **Actionable Steps:**
        * **Develop objective and subjective metrics** to evaluate musical quality (e.g., melodic contour, harmonic progression, rhythmic consistency, user feedback surveys).
        * **Implement iterative testing and refinement loops** focusing specifically on improving coherence in longer pieces.
        * **Investigate advanced AI techniques** or architectural improvements in the generation model to enhance musicality and long-range coherence.
        * **Gather user feedback early and often** on the perceived musical quality of generated outputs.

2.  **Invest in User Experience (UX) for Text Prompting and Guidance:**
    * **Justification:**  Addresses the "Complexity of Textual Descriptions" risk and is crucial for user adoption.  Even a powerful music generator is useless if users can't effectively control it.
    * **Actionable Steps:**
        * **Develop clear and concise guidelines and examples** for effective text prompting.  Provide templates and demonstrate different prompting styles for various musical outcomes.
        * **Design an intuitive user interface** for text input, potentially with interactive elements like genre selectors, mood sliders, or example prompts.
        * **Incorporate a "preview and refine" loop** where users can quickly hear initial outputs and iterate on their text prompts based on the results.
        * **Consider adding a "prompt library"** or community forum where users can share and discover effective prompts.

3.  **Showcase Compelling Music Examples & Demos, Especially Long-Form Pieces:**
    * **Justification:** This is crucial for marketing, demonstrating the system's capabilities (especially its unique selling point of long-form coherence), and attracting initial users.
    * **Actionable Steps:**
        * **Create a dedicated section on the landing page** to showcase high-quality music examples generated by the system.
        * **Focus on demonstrating diverse genres and styles**, highlighting the system's versatility.
        * **Specifically showcase examples of *long-form* pieces** that demonstrate musical coherence over several minutes.
        * **Produce video demos** showcasing the text-to-music generation process and the resulting music in different contexts (e.g., background music for video).

4.  **Iterate and Improve the `music.py` Script (MIDI Conversion and Algorithmic Control):**
    * **Justification:**  Ensures a robust and potentially customizable pipeline from symbolic representation to standard MIDI.  This is a foundational technical improvement impacting output quality and usability.
    * **Actionable Steps:**
        * **Optimize the `music.py` script for efficiency and speed.**
        * **Explore options for adding more musical parameters and algorithmic variations** during the MIDI conversion process (e.g., dynamics, articulation, tempo variations).
        * **Make the `music.py` script potentially more modular and extensible** to allow for future customization and feature additions.
        * **Thoroughly test the script for MIDI compatibility and accuracy** across different MIDI players and DAWs.

5.  **Develop a Clearer Value Proposition & Target Audience Definition:**
    * **Justification:**  While seemingly less technical, this is fundamental for guiding development and marketing efforts.  Knowing the target audience and unique value proposition will inform feature prioritization and overall project direction.
    * **Actionable Steps:**
        * **Conduct market research** to further validate the identified market opportunities and understand specific user needs within each segment (content creators, hobbyists, etc.).
        * **Refine the value proposition** to clearly articulate the unique benefits of this system compared to competitors, emphasizing the "long-form, coherent music" aspect.
        * **Define specific user personas** for the target audience to guide feature development and marketing messaging.
        * **Develop targeted marketing materials** that resonate with each defined user segment, highlighting the specific benefits relevant to them.

These prioritized features focus on addressing the most critical risks and capitalizing on the project's strengths, ultimately aiming to create a musically compelling, user-friendly, and marketable Text-to-MIDI music generation tool.
