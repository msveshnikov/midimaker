Okay, team. Based on the project description for the MidiMaker Generator and our current state (basic project structure with `music.py` and `landing.html` placeholders), let's define our focus for the upcoming sprint.

Our main goal is to establish the core conversion capability â€“ transforming the defined symbolic representation into a usable MIDI file. This validates a critical part of the pipeline before we invest heavily in the LLM generation aspects.

**Product Owner Update - Sprint Planning (Sun Apr 13 2025)**

**1. Prioritized Backlog for Next Sprint:**

Here are the top 5 features/tasks for this sprint:

1.  **Implement Core Symbolic Format Parser (`music.py`)**: Develop the Python logic within `music.py` to read a text file and parse the defined *Compact Symbolic Format*. This includes recognizing and extracting data from `INST`, `T`, `TS`, `K`, `BAR`, `N`, `C`, and `R` tags.
2.  **Implement Basic MIDI File Generation (`music.py`)**: Using a suitable Python MIDI library (e.g., `mido`, `pretty_midi`), translate the parsed symbolic data (notes, chords, rests, tempo, time signature) into a standard MIDI file structure and save it as a `.mid` file.
3.  **Develop Basic Error Handling in Parser (`music.py`)**: Implement rudimentary error handling to gracefully manage common issues like malformed lines, unrecognized tags, or invalid parameter values in the input symbolic file. It should report errors rather than crashing hard.
4.  **Create Sample Symbolic Input Files**: Manually create 2-3 diverse `.txt` files containing music snippets written in the *Compact Symbolic Format*. These will serve as essential test cases for the parser and generator (e.g., one simple piano piece, one with multiple tracks, one demonstrating various durations/chords).
5.  **Add Basic Command-Line Interface (CLI) to `music.py`**: Implement simple command-line arguments for `music.py` to accept the input symbolic file path and the desired output MIDI file path (e.g., `python music.py --input music.txt --output output.mid`). This makes the script directly usable and testable.

**2. Explanation for Prioritization:**

*   **#1 & #2 (Parser & MIDI Generation):** These form the absolute core of the conversion process. Without them, the symbolic format generated by the LLM (in later stages) is useless. We need to validate this fundamental step first.
*   **#3 (Error Handling):** LLM outputs can be unpredictable. Building basic robustness into the parser early will save significant headaches later. It allows us to identify issues in generated symbolic text more easily.
*   **#4 (Sample Files):** We need concrete examples to develop and test against. Manually creating these ensures we have valid inputs before tackling LLM generation variance.
*   **#5 (CLI):** Provides a necessary mechanism to run and test the `music.py` script independently, decoupling it from potential future UI (`landing.html`) or complex LLM integration work for now.

**3. Suggestions for Potential New Features or Improvements (Post-Sprint):**

*   **LLM Integration - Step 2:** Implement the core LLM call to generate a *single section* of music in the symbolic format based on a detailed prompt.
*   **Web Interface (`landing.html` + Backend):** Develop a simple UI to input the initial text description, display the generated symbolic text, trigger the MIDI conversion, and potentially offer a download link for the MIDI file.
*   **Enhanced Symbolic Format:** Start incorporating elements from "Future Enhancements," like articulation markers or basic dynamic changes (e.g., `DYN:mf`).
*   **Concatenation Logic:** Implement the step to combine multiple symbolic section files into one.
*   **Music Playback:** Integrate a JavaScript MIDI player into `landing.html` to allow immediate playback of the generated MIDI.
*   **Configuration File:** Implement the `config.yaml` or similar for managing defaults (tempo, key, etc.) and potentially format definitions.

**4. Risks and Concerns:**

*   **Symbolic Format Ambiguity:** The current format might have unforeseen ambiguities or limitations when translating to MIDI (e.g., precise timing of overlapping notes, track mapping).
*   **MIDI Library Choice:** Selecting the right MIDI library (`mido` vs. `pretty_midi` vs. others) has implications for ease of use, feature support, and potential dependencies.
*   **Parsing Complexity:** Even with basic error handling, accurately parsing potentially flawed LLM output could be more complex than anticipated.
*   **Scope Creep:** Temptation to add more symbolic features or start LLM integration before the core parser/generator is stable.
*   **Testing Gaps:** Manually created sample files might not cover all edge cases encountered with LLM-generated output later.

**5. Recommendations for the Development Team:**

*   **Focus on the Core:** Concentrate on implementing the parser and MIDI generator for the *currently defined* symbolic format accurately this sprint. Resist adding format enhancements yet.
*   **Choose MIDI Library:** Evaluate and decide on the primary MIDI library early in the sprint. Consider `pretty_midi` for potentially easier handling of timing and high-level structures, or `mido` for lower-level control if needed.
*   **Prioritize Testability:** Use the sample symbolic files actively during development. Consider writing basic unit tests for parsing functions if feasible.
*   **Keep it Simple:** For the CLI and error handling, implement the minimum required for usability and basic robustness. We can refine these later.
*   **Document Assumptions:** As you implement the parser (`music.py`), document any assumptions made about the symbolic format or its translation to MIDI (e.g., how bar lines affect timing calculations).

Let's focus on building a solid foundation for the symbolic-to-MIDI conversion this sprint. Good luck!
