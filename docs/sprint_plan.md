Okay, here is the Sprint Plan for the upcoming sprint, based on the current backlog and project state.

## Sprint Plan: Sprint 1 - Core Conversion Foundation

**Sprint Dates:** Mon Apr 14 2025 - Fri Apr 25 2025 *(Assuming a 2-week sprint starting next Monday)*

**Product Owner:** Product Owner Agent
**Development Team:** *(Assumed team)*

### 1. Sprint Goal

**Establish the core conversion pipeline: Parse the essential elements of the v1.0 symbolic format (`N:`, `C:`, `R:`, `BAR:`, `T:`, `TS:`) and generate a basic, playable MIDI file using default or parsed settings.**

This sprint focuses on building the fundamental `music.py` script capabilities, enabling the conversion from a simple symbolic text file to a MIDI file, proving the core concept.

### 2. Selected Backlog Items

The following high-priority items (P1) have been selected from the Product Backlog for this sprint:

| Priority | Item ID | User Story / Task                                     | Estimate (SP) | Notes                                                                 |
| :------- | :------ | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | P1.4    | Define & Document Initial Symbolic Format v1.0        | 3 SP          | Prerequisite for parsing logic. Focus on elements needed for this sprint. |
| 2        | P1.1    | Implement Core Symbolic Format Parser (`music.py`)    | 5 SP          | Parse `N:`, `C:`, `R:`, `BAR:`. Store events internally.                  |
| 3        | P1.2    | Implement Basic MIDI File Generation (`music.py`)     | 8 SP          | Convert internal events to MIDI using a library. Calculate timings.     |
| 4        | P1.3    | Implement Metadata Parsing (`music.py`)               | 5 SP          | Parse `T:`, `TS:`, `K:`, `INST:`. Use T/TS for timing; embed others.   |
| 5        | P1.5    | Basic Command-Line Interface for `music.py`           | 2 SP          | Allow `python music.py input.txt output.mid` execution for testing. |
| **Total**|         |                                                       | **23 SP**     |                                                                       |

*(SP = Story Points. Estimates are relative effort/complexity.)*

### 3. Dependencies and Risks

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **P1.1 (Core Parser) & P1.3 (Metadata Parser) depend on P1.4 (Format Definition):** The format must be clearly defined before or during implementation.
    *   **P1.2 (MIDI Gen) depends on P1.1 (Parsed Data):** The parser needs to provide structured data to the MIDI generator.
    *   **P1.2 (MIDI Gen) depends on selecting and integrating a Python MIDI library:** (e.g., `mido`, `pretty_midi`). This choice needs to be made early.
    *   **P1.3 (Metadata Parser) affects P1.2 (MIDI Gen):** Parsed Tempo (T:) and Time Signature (TS:) are needed for accurate timing calculations in MIDI generation.
    *   **P1.5 (CLI) depends on P1.1, P1.2, P1.3:** The core functionality needs to exist to be testable via the CLI.
*   **Risks:**
    *   **MIDI Library Complexity:** The chosen MIDI library might have a steeper learning curve or limitations affecting P1.2 implementation. (Mitigation: Research and select library early, potentially spike/prototype).
    *   **Format Ambiguity:** The initial format definition (P1.4) might overlook edge cases, requiring rework in the parser (P1.1/P1.3). (Mitigation: Thoroughly review format definition, use clear examples).
    *   **Timing Calculation Complexity:** Accurately converting symbolic durations and bar markers into absolute MIDI ticks based on tempo and time signature (P1.2/P1.3) can be tricky. (Mitigation: Allocate sufficient time, create specific test cases for timing).
    *   **Underestimation:** Particularly for P1.2 (MIDI Generation), the effort might be higher than estimated. (Mitigation: Break down P1.2 into smaller sub-tasks during sprint planning).

### 4. Definition of Done (DoD)

An item is considered "Done" when:

1.  All functional requirements outlined in the User Story/Task description and Acceptance Criteria are met.
2.  Code is written and adheres to agreed-upon coding standards.
3.  Unit tests are written for new logic (especially parsing and MIDI conversion functions) and all tests pass.
4.  The code is reviewed and approved by at least one other team member (if applicable).
5.  Functionality is manually tested using the CLI (P1.5) with sample symbolic input files.
6.  Relevant documentation (Symbolic Format v1.0 - P1.4) is created or updated.
7.  Code is successfully merged into the main development branch.

**Sprint Review Goal:** Demonstrate the `music.py` script successfully converting a sample `.txt` file (containing notes, chords, rests, bars, and metadata) into a playable `.mid` file via the command line interface.
